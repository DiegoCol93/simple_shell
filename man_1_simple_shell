.\"
.\"  -This was the final project of the first trimester at Holberton school
.\"     in the campus of Bogot√°, Colombia, Cohort 13.
.\"
.\"  -We were given 2 weeks from Nov-11-2020 to Nov-26-2020 and we were
.\"     given a few basic tasks to begin such a demmanding project.
.\"
.\"  ------- Space for hopefully including a link to all of the basic
.\"     tasks we were given, solved and explained.
.\"
.\"  -The description of the sofware created on the span of 2 weeks is
.\"     located here, and any use or distribution of this software and
.\"     any of its contents is permitted, but without the modification
.\"     of the description contained within this comment section and any
.\"     comment sections contained within the source files.
.\"
.\"  -Any and all contributions are welcome and should be sent over the
.\"     official git hub repositoty at:
.\"
.\"      https://github.com/DiegoCol93/simple_shell
.\"
.\"  -To add this man page to your man pages change the name of this
.\"     file to hsh.1.gz if it's not already and run this command:
.\"
.\"      sudo cp hsh.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/
.\"
.\"    And you would've added this file into the man 1 directory,
.\"     you may now run:
.\"
.\"      man hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh

or Holberton simple shell, is a command line interpreter or
.B
shell
following the tradition of the first
.B Unix
shell written by
.B Ken Thompson
in 1971.

This program is an interpreter of the commands written into it, that is,
this is a program that reads the characters from the
.B STDIN
looking for a command entered by the user after the
.B prompt
simbolized by a dollar sign and a pipeline

providing an interface for the user as follows:
, on our custom
.B prompt

.RS 4
.B $ | 
_ , the underscore 
.B _
denotes where the user input goes.
.RE

It reads, interprets and executes the command for the corresponding
.B Linux
program or
.B executable
found in the user's
.B PATH
, current directory or by direct path call, with the
arguments used by the program being called.

Standard C functions and system calls employed for this simple_shell are:

.B execve()
.B exit()
.B fork()
.B free()
.B stat()
.B getline()
.B malloc()
.B perror()
.B signal()
.B stat()
.B wait()
.B write()

Currently working on it.
